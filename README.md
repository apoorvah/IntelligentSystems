Route planning

Set-Up:
The area is mapped into a grid, wherein each square is marked as either "accessible" or "inaccessible"
There exists a robot that can move left, right, up and down. However, the robot has a limited battery capacity, allowing it to make at most 20 such moves.

Objective:
Given the file Planet.java, 
1. Find the optimal sequence of moves for the robot that maximises the number of different grid squares it can visit.
2. Compute the smallest amount of battery life that would allow the landing craft to explore every accessible square in the grid.
